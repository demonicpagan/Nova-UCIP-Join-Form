The following application will alter your join form for use with the UCIP organization. To install this
application you need to perform the following steps.

1. Use the included nova_ucip_join.sql file to add the needed sql table fields to your nova installation.

2. Upload application/controllers/characters.php to your application/controllers folder of your Nova install 
replacing the existing one if you haven't already modified this file. If you already have changes in this file, 
it's best that you just take the contents of this file and add it into your existing characters.php file.

3. Upload application/controllers/main.php to your application/controllers folder of your Nova install replacing 
the existing one if you haven't already modified this file. If you already have changes in this file, it's best 
that you just take the contents of this file and add it into your existing main.php file.

4. Upload application/controllers/personnel.php to your application/controllers folder of your Nova install replacing 
the existing one if you haven't already modified this file. If you already have changes in this file, it's best 
that you just take the contents of this file and add it into your existing personnel.php file.

3. Add the following line into your base_lang.php for your associated language(s) after the rest of the includes 
and before the Global items.
	/* include UCIP Join Language file */
	include_once APPPATH .'language/'. $language . '/ucip_lang.php';

4. Upload application/language/english/ucip_lang.php to your 
application/views/language/english folder of your Nova install. Translate this page into other languages and upload
them to the appropriate language directories. (If you would like your language included into a future release, 
please contact me via email.)

7. Upload application/views/_base_override/main/pages/main_join_2.php to your
application/views/_base_override/main/pages folder of your Nova install.

8. Upload application/views/_base_override/main/pages/personnel_character.php to your
application/views/_base_override/main/pages folder of your Nova install.

9. Upload application/views/_base_override/main/js/main_join_js.php to your
application/views/_base_override/main/js folder of your Nova install.

10. Upload application/views/_base_override/admin/pages/characters_bio.php to your
application/views/_base_override/admin/pages folder of your Nova install.

11. Upload application/models/characters_model.php to your application/models folder of your Nova install.
